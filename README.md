# FÃ¼r Graphics

Our project is to have an animated piano-like interface where users can press keys on their keyboards to make visual changes pop up depending on which keys they press.

### Code Location

Most of the code are located in `./examples/shadow-demo.js`. You can copy that file into the `examples` folder of your repos (like assignments or team project), it should be compatible and you can import it as your main scene.
